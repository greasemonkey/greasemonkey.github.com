<h1>Contributing To Greasemonkey</h1>

<p>This document is a stub and should be improved.</p>

<h2>Git</h2>
<p>Greasemonkey source code is managed via Git.  Git is a very different version control system, and you should learn how to use it.</p>

<p>Links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://progit.org/">Pro Git</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.gitready.com/">Git Ready</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Most importantly, all independent changes should be isolated into separate branches.  Any given branch should be clearly explained and proposed for inclusion in Greasemonkey via the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/greasemonkey-dev">greasemonkey-dev mailing list</a>, or the <a href="http://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey/issues">issue ticket</a> if there is an appropriate one.</p>

<h2>Change One Thing</h2>

<p>When proposing a change to the source code, change exactly one thing.  Do not refactor some existing code, and add new code for a new feature at the same time.</p>

<h2>Be Inclusive</h2>

<p>Please include the entire development community when hacking on Greasemonkey.  Discussion on the mailing list is highly encouraged.  Discussion on the appropriate issue is often equally appropriate.</p>
